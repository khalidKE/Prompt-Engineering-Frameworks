## APE Framework

**APE = Action – Process – Expectation**

**Components:**

1. **Action** – Specify exactly what the AI should do.
2. **Process** – Define *how* it should perform the task.
3. **Expectation** – Describe the final output format or goal.

**Example:**

```text
Action: Explain solar energy.
Process: Explain step by step with examples.
Expectation: Three short paragraphs suitable for a 12-year-old student.
```

**Use:** Technical, educational, or analytical tasks.

## RACE Framework

**RACE = Role – Action – Context – Expectation**

**Components:**

1. **Role** – Define the role AI should take.
2. **Action** – Specify the exact task.
3. **Context** – Provide background info for better understanding.
4. **Expectation** – Specify the format or quality of output.

**Example:**

```text
Role: You are a high school history teacher.
Action: Explain the French Revolution.
Context: Students are 16 years old and need simplified examples.
Expectation: 4 short paragraphs with a real-life example.
```

**Use:** Audience-targeted content or educational purposes.
